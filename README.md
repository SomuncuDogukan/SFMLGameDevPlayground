Welcome to SFMLGameDevPlayground, a repository dedicated to learning and experimenting with game development using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
Overview

This repository serves as a playground for creating simple 2D and 3D games using SFML. The goal is to explore game development concepts starting with 2D games and gradually transitioning to 3D games in separate branches.
Project Structure

    2D Branch: Contains projects and experiments related to 2D game development using SFML.
    3D Branch: Focuses on evolving the projects into 3D games using SFML and related tools.
